# Automated-Schedule-Generation

**Development of a software module and web application for creating class schedules for university courses**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Manual timetable creation in universities is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable for modern modular academic systems. This project delivers a software module and web application that **automatically generates university class schedules using a genetic algorithm**, tailored to Astana IT University's constraints and needs.

- **Students:** Azimzhanov Rakhim, Baibossyn Aniyar, Murat Almas  
- **Department:** Computer Science, Astana IT University

## 💡 Motivation

Manual scheduling struggles with complexity, scale, and the variety of constraints in academic environments. Our platform aims to:

- Automate the process of schedule creation for courses, groups, rooms, and instructors.
- Minimize conflicts and reduce student idle time.
- Provide a flexible and user-friendly web-based interface.
